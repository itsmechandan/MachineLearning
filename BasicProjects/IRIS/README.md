The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization.

-In the Data_visualisation python file, I have simple put out all the different versions of seeing the Data set. To Do: Depict In 3-D the Features


-In Logistic Regression, I have emphasised More on The Parameter 'c' which is called the regularisation function and also tried to prove the concept of Over Fitting. To Do: Use other Parameters as well, use Cross Validation, Grid Search CV as well.
